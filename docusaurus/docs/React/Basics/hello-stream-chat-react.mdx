title: Hello Stream Chat React
---

Here's a high level overview of SDK setup and the core components and how they fit together. It's a great starting point, and you can follow along in your code editor though it's not completely exhaustive in terms setting up a React project or instructions on creating specific files.
For a step-by-step guide in that sense, see: https://getstream.io/chat/react-chat/tutorial/

## Your first app with Stream Chat React!

Before starting, make sure you have installed `stream-chat-react` (and `stream-chat`) as directed in the 'About' section.

Below is the few lines of JSX code required for a fully functioning chat experience. The `Chat` and `Channel` components are React context providers that pass a variety of values to their children including UI components, channel state data, and messaging functions.

```ts
const App = () => (
  <Chat client={chatClient} theme='messaging light'>
    <Channel channel={channel}>
      <Window>
        <ChannelHeader />
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Window>
      <Thread />
    </Channel>
  </Chat>
);
```

Read on for more information on two crucial aspects to SDK setup, the client prop on the `Chat` component and the channel prop on `Channel`.

## Creating a Chat Client

To interact with Stream's chat services, you must get an instance of Stream Chat and for this you will need an api key. To create one you can sign up for a [free 30-day trial](https://getstream.io/chat/trial/). Initialize a chatClient: 

```ts
import { StreamChat } from 'stream-chat';

const chatClient = StreamChat.getInstance('api_key');
```

Adding your client via the client prop injects this value into the `ChatContext`, and since `Chat` wraps the entire application, this value is now accessible in all child components via `useChatContext`.

```ts
const { client } = useChatContext();
```

## Connecting a User

Tokens are used to authenticate a user. Typically, you send this token from your backend to the client when a user registers or logs in. See the [Tokens & Authentication](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/tokens_and_authentication/) documentation to
learn more about creating tokens. For our purposes here, we will assume you have created and retrieved a `userToken`.

To connect a user, the `connectUser` function on your client instance should be called and provided with the user object and `userToken`.
Connecting a user could be done in the login flow or elsewhere in the application after the client is instantiated.

```ts
chatClient.connectUser(
  {
    id: 'dave-matthews',
    name: 'Dave Matthews',
  },
  userToken,
);
```

## Creating a Channel

Channels are at the core of Stream Chat; they are where messages are contained, sent, and interacted with. Letâ€™s initialize a channel to inject into the `Channel` component.

A [channel type](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/react/channel_features/) is required when creating a channel and dictates the features and permissions associated with a given channel.
There are 5 default types of channels.

- `livestream`
- `messaging`
- `team`
- `gaming`
- `commerce`

These options provide you with sensible defaults for the named use cases. You can also define custom channel types.

The first two arguments to create a channel via the channel method on our client instance are the channel type and the channel id.
A channel must be initialized with either an id or a list of members for the channel. If you provide a list of members an id will be auto-generated on backend for the channel.

For the

```ts
const channel = chatClient.channel('messaging', 'dave-matthews-channel', {
  // add as many custom fields as you'd like
  name: 'Creating a Messaging Channel',
  members: ['dave-matthews'],
})
```
