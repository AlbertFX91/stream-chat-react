## How-to Guide for Customizing the ChannelList UI

To customize the UI for the [`ChannelList`](../core-components/channel-list.mdx) you need to focus on the two wrapper components that dictate the UI, the list and preview components. These are set via the optional `List` and `Preview` props, and if nothing is provided they default to
[`ChannelListMessenger`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/blob/master/src/components/ChannelList/ChannelListMessenger.tsx)
and [`ChannelPreviewMessenger`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/blob/master/src/components/ChannelPreview/ChannelPreviewMessenger.tsx). 

Let's individually build these two components to use to override the defaults.

## The List component 

The list component used by `ChannelList` receives the same props as the default, and is a container that renders the list of channels via the children prop. The code below is an example of the minimum viable soluttion as a possible return block
for a custom list component.

```jsx
  return (
    <div>{props.children}</div>
  );
```

Using the default `ChannelListMessenger` component as a model, let's incorporate the other props to render the list conditionally.

```jsx
if (props.error) {
  return <div>Warning! Error Message!</div>;
}

if (props.loading) {
  return null;
}
```

The items we're rendering in those conditionals are not very helpful for the user, so let's take advantage of several of the library's status indicator components via the `LoadingErrorIndicator` and `LoadingIndicator`
props and assign the default values for each, `ChatDown` and `LoadingChannels`. This assignment is necessary here to satisfy TypeScript since these props are optional.

```jsx
import { ChatDown, LoadingChannels } from 'stream-chat-react';

const {
  LoadingErrorIndicator = ChatDown,
  LoadingIndicator = LoadingChannels,
} = props;

if (error) {
  return <LoadingErrorIndicator type={'connection'} />;
}

if (loading) {
  return <LoadingIndicator />;
}
```

If you would like to use a custom component (or a different library component) for either the `LoadingErrorIndicactor` or `LoadingIndicator` props in the custom component (and in the default list component, too),
you can utilize the props of the same names on `ChannelList`. If either of these props are provided, then the assignment mentioned in the above step is not necessary.

```jsx
const CustomErrorIndicator = (props: ChatDownProps) => {
  return <div>So much error when rendering.</div>
};

<ChannelList
  LoadingErrorIndicator={(props) => (
    <CustomErrorIndicator {...props} type={'connection'} />
  )}
/>
```

This is a basic example of how you can create a custom list component using all of the provided props, though the only one that is actually necessary for a functional component is children.
It's possible to render any addtional UI items or incorporate other logic that you'd need to fit your requirements within your custom component.

**The Code:**

```jsx
const CustomList = (props: PropsWithChildren<ChannelListMessengerProps>) => {
  const {
    children,
    error,
    loading,
    LoadingErrorIndicator,
    LoadingIndicator,
  } = props;

  if (error) {
    return <LoadingErrorIndicator type={'connection'} />;
  }

  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingIndicator />;
  }

  return (
    <div>{children}</div>
  );
};

const CustomErrorIndicator = (props: ChatDownProps) => {
  return <div>So much error when rendering.</div>
};

const CustomLoadingIndicator = () => {
  return <div>Loading, loading, loading...</div>
};

<Chat client={client}>
  <ChannelList
    List={CustomList}
    LoadingErrorIndicator={(props) => (
      <CustomErrorIndicator {...props} type={'connection'} />
    )}
    LoadingIndicator={CustomLoadingIndicator}
  />
  <Channel>
    <MessageList />
    <MessageInput />
  </Channel>
</Chat>;
```

## The Preview component

The `Preview` prop dictates the design and click functionality of an individual channel in the list that we built above. Let's build a custom preview component.
