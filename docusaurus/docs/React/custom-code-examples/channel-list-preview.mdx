`ChannelList` UI is determined by two of its props, `List` and `Preview`. The `List` prop allows you to customize the container
in which the array of channels is rendered. The `Preview` prop dictates the design and click functionality of an individual
channel in the list. If not provided via props, these UI components fall back to the default components.

To customize the container and list item UI for your `ChannelList`, provide custom component overrides. Your custom components
will receive the same props as the defaults.

```jsx
const CustomListContainer = (props) => {
  // render custom list container here
};

const CustomListItem = (props) => {
  // render custom list item here
};

<Chat client={client}>
  <ChannelList List={CustomListContainer} Preview={CustomListItem} />
  <Channel>
    <MessageList />
    <MessageInput />
  </Channel>
</Chat>;
```
