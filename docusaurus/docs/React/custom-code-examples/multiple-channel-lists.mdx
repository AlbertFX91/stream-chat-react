title: Multiple Channel Lists
---

This example will focus on the specific use case where there are two `ChannelList` components in the same application.

The event listeners of both lists, let's say A and B, will pick up all `new.message` events for every `channel`, regardless of which list the `message` lives in.
If a message is sent in list B, the event listener in list A will also pick up the new `message` and bump the impacted `channel` to the top of the list. This is not the desired result for multiples lists, but there is a correct way to handle the routing of these messages

## allowNewMessagesFromUnfilteredChannels prop

The default behavior of the `ChannelList` components is that a `channel` is automatically pushed to the top of the list, and if the `channel` doesn't currently exist in the list, then it is retrieved from `client.activeChannels`. By setting the
`allowNewMessagesFromUnfilteredChannels` prop to false, then a `channel` not already in the list will be prevented from incrementing. This is exactly what we will want when we have two list components present. See the code below for the prop set to false.


```jsx
    <ChannelList
      filters={filters}
      sort={sort}
      options={options}
      allowNewMessagesFromUnfilteredChannels={false}
  />
```
