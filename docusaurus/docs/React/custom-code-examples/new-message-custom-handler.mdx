Hello!

The problem: when a client creates an app with two ChannelList
components (think team channels and DMs in Slack), the event listeners will pick up new message events in both lists.
Assume two lists, A and B. If a message is sent to a channel in list B, the new message event listener in A will also pick up the event and bump the
channel to the top of its list as well.

Create an app with two ChannelList components, each with a different channel type. Create a custom
onMessageNew function and pass as a prop to ChannelList and ensure channels are only
bumped to the top of their respective list when a new message arrives.
