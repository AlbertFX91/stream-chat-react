There is a possibility that there could be two `ChannelList` components in the same application. The event listeners of both lists, let's say A and B, will pick up all new message events. If a message is sent to a `channel` in list B, the event listener in list A will
also pick it up and bump it to the top of the list. This example will focus on this specific use case by demonstrating how to correctly handle the routing of these messages.

## onNewMessage prop

We will utilize the `onNewMessage` prop on `ChannelList` to add our custom logic to handle the new messages being sent in both of our lists.




Create an app with two ChannelList components, each with a different channel type. Create a custom
onMessageNew function and pass as a prop to ChannelList and ensure channels are only
bumped to the top of their respective list when a new message arrives.
