## Overview

The `VirtualizedMessageList` component renders a scrollable list of messages. The UI for each individual message is rendered
conditionally based on its `message.type` value. The list renders date separators, new message notifications, system
messages, deleted messages, and standard messages containing text and/or attachments.

By default, the `VirtualizedMessageList` loads the most recent 25 messages held in the `channel.state`. More messages are fetched
from the Stream Chat API and loaded into the DOM on scrolling up the list. The currently loaded messages are held in
the `ChannelStateContext` and can be referenced with our custom hook.

```jsx
const { messages } = useChannelStateContext();
```

The `VirtualizedMessageList` has no required props and by default pulls overridable data from the various contexts established
in the [`Channel`](./channel.mdx) component. Customization of the messages rendered within the list is handled by
the [Message UI](../message-components/message-ui.mdx) component.

## Basic Usage

As a context consumer, the `VirtualizedMessageList` component must be rendered as a child of the `Channel` component. It can be
rendered with or without a provided `messages` prop. Providing your own `messages` value will override the default
value drawn from the `ChannelStateContext`.

**Example 1** - without `messages` prop

```jsx
<Chat client={client}>
  <ChannelList />
  <Channel>
    <VirtualizedMessageList />
    <MessageInput />
  </Channel>
</Chat>
```

**Example 2** - with `messages` prop

```jsx
const customMessages = [
  // array of messages
];

<Chat client={client}>
  <ChannelList />
  <Channel>
    <VirtualizedMessageList messages={customMessages} />
    <MessageInput />
  </Channel>
</Chat>;
```
